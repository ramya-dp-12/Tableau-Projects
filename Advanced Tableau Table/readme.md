# Advanced Tableau Table Project

In today's data-driven world, the ability to effectively visualize and interpret data is paramount. The Advanced Tableau Table project aims to provide a comprehensive platform for understanding complex datasets through advanced visualization techniques. Leveraging the power of Tableau, this project focuses on creating intricate and detailed tables that offer in-depth insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

## Project Overview
This document serves as documentation for the Advanced Tableau Table project, which aims to analyze and visualize complex datasets using advanced Tableau features. The project involves data exploration, table creation, data cleaning, and the development of detailed visualizations using Tableau.

## Project Scope
The project utilizes data from various sources, focusing on metrics such as sales performance, customer demographics, and product analysis. The data exploration phase involves SQL queries to extract, clean, and transform the dataset for analysis. Subsequently, advanced tables and visualizations are developed in Tableau to present key insights and trends.

## Tools and Technologies
The project utilizes the following tools and technologies:

- **SQL (Structured Query Language):** The primary language used for data manipulation, exploration, and analysis.
- **Tableau:** For creating advanced visualizations and interactive dashboards based on SQL query findings.
- **Excel:** The initial file type for data exploration, as the dataset obtained was in Excel format.

This combination of tools facilitates a comprehensive approach to the analysis, from database creation and exploration using SQL to visual representation and interactive dashboards in Tableau.

## Data Exploration
The dataset contains various metrics such as sales performance, customer demographics, and product analysis. The data exploration phase involves SQL scripts executed on SQL Server to prepare the dataset for analysis.

- **Table Creation SQL Script:**
  - Specifying the specific database name
  - Creating tables from the raw dataset
  - Retrieving column data types and correcting them as necessary for easier data exploration

- **Data Exploration SQL Script:**
  - Selecting relevant data for analysis
  - Finding potential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, total profit, and customer acquisition
  - Conducting comparative analysis:
    - Comparing sales performance across different regions
    - Sorting products by highest sales and profit margins
    - Calculating metrics like average order value and customer lifetime value

## Tableau Dashboard
The Tableau dashboard is designed to visualize key insights and trends related to sales performance, customer demographics, and product analysis. The dashboard includes KPIs, detailed tables, text charts, symbol maps, and area graphs to provide a comprehensive overview of the dataset.

### Dashboard Components:
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
  - Total sales revenue
  - Total profit
  - Customer acquisition
- **Text Chart:**
  - Sales and profit by product/category
- **Symbol Map:**
  - Sales distribution by region
- **Area Graphs:**
  - Sales revenue over time by region
  - Profit over time by region
  - Customer acquisition over time

## Project Conclusion
The Advanced Tableau Table project has provided invaluable insights into complex datasets through meticulous data analysis and advanced visualization techniques. By leveraging SQL queries and Tableau's capabilities, the project distilled intricate datasets into actionable insights accessible to a broad audience. The interactive Tableau dashboard serves as a centralized platform for tracking key metrics and empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions. Moving forward, these insights will continue to inform business strategies and shape planning, highlighting the project's lasting impact on data-driven decision-making.

## Recommendations and Future Work
- Continuously update the dashboard with the latest data.
- Enhance interactivity and user experience by adding more filters and drill-down options.
- Conduct further analysis to identify correlations and causal relationships between variables.
